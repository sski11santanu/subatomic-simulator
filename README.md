# subatomic-simulator

* This is a simple leisure web program to simulate
subatomic particles (electron, neutron, proton) and
the interaction between them (attraction, repulsion).

* Tap on the screen to add a random subatomic
particle. Add multiple particles to see the
interactions (forces) between them.

* Both electrostatic as well as gravitational forces
are simulated (the former type is MUCH STRONGER than the
latter one.
